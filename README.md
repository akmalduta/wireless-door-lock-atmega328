# wireless-door-lock-atmega328
This project implements a wireless-controlled door lock system using the ATmega328p microcontroller, an SPI-based wireless module (like nRF24L01), a TFT LCD for display feedback, and a servo motor for the physical locking mechanism.

## 📦 How to Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wireless-door-lock-atmega328p.git
   ```

2. Open the `/code` folder in Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your ATmega328p board.
4. Upload the code.
5. Power up and monitor behavior via LCD and servo.
